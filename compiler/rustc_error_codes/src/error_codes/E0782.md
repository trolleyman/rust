A double quote f-string (`f"`) was not terminated.

Erroneous code example:

```compile_fail,E0782
let s = f"; // error!
```

```compile_fail,E0782
let s = f"foo{; // error!
```

To fix this error, add the missing double quote at the end of the string, or close the opened brace:

```
let s = f""; // ok!
```

```
let s = f"foo{ 1 }"; // ok!
```
